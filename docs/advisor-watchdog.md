# Advisor, WATCHDOG.md, and WATCHDOG.yml

The advisor is an optional second model attached to a session. It reviews the primary agent's transcript after each turn, inspects the workspace with its own tools, and injects concise advice back into the primary session.

The advisor is not a second executor: it cannot approve actions or change primary session state directly. Its default toolset is read-only (`read`, `grep`, `glob`) plus `advise`, but a `WATCHDOG.yml` roster entry may broaden `tools:` to any built-in — including mutating tools such as `edit`, `write`, `bash`, `eval`, and `browser` — so grant those tools only when the advisor model and workspace are trusted (see [Tools and isolation](#tools-and-isolation)).

## Enabling the advisor

The advisor requires both:

1. `advisor.enabled: true`
2. a model assigned to the `advisor` model role

Example:

```yaml
modelRoles:
  advisor: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:medium

advisor:
  enabled: true
```

The advisor role uses normal model-role resolution, including provider-prefixed ids, canonical ids, and optional thinking suffixes.

### Headless runs

Use `--advisor` to enable the advisor for one print-mode process without
persisting `advisor.enabled`:

```sh
omp -p --advisor "Review this task."
```

While a primary prompt is running, advisor concerns and blockers continue to steer that live turn. After the final prompt settles, print mode preserves late advisor notes without starting hidden primary turns, then waits up to ten minutes for final reviews before disposing the session. Error exits use a 30-second drain budget so failed automation can terminate. If either deadline expires, OMP logs the reviews that disposal will abandon; completed reviews retain their transcript and token/cost usage.

Slash commands:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/advisor` | Toggle the persisted `advisor.enabled` setting. |
| `/advisor on` | Enable the setting and start the runtime when an advisor model is assigned. |
| `/advisor off` | Disable the setting and stop the runtime. |
| `/advisor status` | Show active model, context usage, token usage, and cost. |
| `/advisor dump` | Copy the advisor's compact transcript to the clipboard. |
| `/advisor dump raw` | Copy the advisor's full dump (system prompt, tools, thinking, and calls) to the clipboard. |

If `advisor.enabled` is true but no `modelRoles.advisor` value resolves to an available model, status reports that the setting is enabled but no advisor model is assigned.

## What the advisor sees

At each primary turn end, `AdvisorRuntime` receives only the new transcript delta since the last advisor update. Deltas are rendered with `formatSessionHistoryMarkdown(..., { includeThinking: true, includeToolIntent: true, watchedRoles: true, expandPrimaryContext: true })`, so the advisor can review assistant reasoning as well as user-visible text, tool calls, and tool results.

Most hidden `custom` messages collapse to a one-line summary in the delta. The exception is the primary agent's injected constraint context — the types in `PRIMARY_CONTEXT_CUSTOM_TYPES` (`plan-mode-context`, `plan-mode-reference`). `expandPrimaryContext` renders these verbatim inside a `<primary-context kind="…">` wrapper (XML-escaped, so plan/objective text cannot break out or read as advisor instructions). Without this the advisor only saw a 120-char truncation of the plan-mode rules — which cut off mid-sentence at `NEVER create, edit, or delete files — excep…`, hiding the "except the single plan file" carve-out and producing false blockers against the agent writing its own plan file. Because these prompts are re-injected verbatim every primary turn, `AdvisorRuntime` dedupes them: a byte-identical re-injection collapses to a `(unchanged — still in effect)` marker, and the full body re-expands whenever the content changes or the advisor re-primes. `goal-mode-context` is deliberately excluded — its live budget counters change every turn, so it can neither dedupe nor expand cheaply.

Advisor messages already injected into the primary transcript are filtered out before the next delta is rendered. This prevents the advisor from recursively reviewing its own advice.

When the primary transcript is rewritten, the advisor runtime is reset:

- compaction
- session switch/resume
- branch/fork style history replacement
- context-maintenance re-prime when the advisor's own context cannot fit

Reset clears the advisor's private in-memory transcript and rewinds its cursor. The next advisor update replays the current bounded primary transcript instead of continuing from stale pre-rewrite context.

When the advisor is enabled mid-session, the cursor seeds to the current primary transcript length. That avoids replaying the whole old conversation on the first enabled turn.

## Tools and isolation

The advisor is a full agent with its own `Agent` instance and a distinct `ToolSession` whose id is suffixed `-advisor`. The advisor therefore does not share the primary agent's file snapshots, seen-lines tracking, conflict state, summary cache, or edit/yield capabilities.

Every advisor has the `advise` tool for surfacing notes into the primary transcript. Its investigative pool defaults to the read-only subset:

- `read`
- `grep`
- `glob`

A `WATCHDOG.yml` roster entry may broaden this with `tools: [...]`, selecting any subset of the built-in pool the session actually built (a factory that returned `null`, e.g. `lsp` with no matching servers, is absent). Grantable tools include mutating ones: `edit`, `write`, `bash`, `eval`, `browser`, `debug`, `ast_edit`, `task`, `hub`, and the memory tools. Tool names outside [`BUILTIN_TOOL_NAMES`](../packages/coding-agent/src/tools/builtin-names.ts) are dropped with a warning.

Advisor grants are not routed through the primary agent's approval wrapper. The advisor pool is built from the built-in tool factories against its own `-advisor` `ToolSession` and then filtered by `WATCHDOG.yml`; it is not the primary `toolRegistry` wrapped with `ExtensionToolWrapper`. Granting write- or exec-tier tools therefore lets the advisor invoke those tools directly, subject to the tool's own runtime guards but not to `tools.approvalMode` / `tools.approval.<tool>` prompts. Keep mutating grants narrow and trusted.

The `advise` tool accepts one note and an optional severity:

| Severity | Delivery | Intended use |
|---|---|---|
| omitted / `nit` | Non-interrupting aside, batched into the primary transcript at the next step boundary. | Cleanup, simplification, low-risk edge cases. |
| `concern` | Interrupting steering message when the delivery constraints below permit it. A late terminal-answer `concern` is preserved as a visible card instead. | Material risk, likely wrong direction, missing constraint, hallucinated API. |
| `blocker` | Interrupting steering message when the delivery constraints below permit it. Unlike a `concern`, a terminal answer alone does not prevent it from triggering a turn. | Continuing would clearly waste work or produce broken output. |

Interrupting advice is sent through the steering channel and can abort in-flight tools at the next steering boundary. Each note (interrupting or batched) is rendered into the primary transcript as an `<advisory>` element — severity rides a `severity` attribute, and a `guidance` attribute carries the "weigh, don't blindly obey" framing (the primary agent's system prompt never mentions advisories, so the tag is its only cue). Note bodies are XML-escaped so advice containing `<`, `>`, or `&` can't break the wrapper:

```text
<advisory severity="concern" guidance="weigh, don't blindly obey">
note text
</advisory>
```

When you deliberately interrupt the agent (Esc, or a cancel from collab, ACP, RPC, the SDK, or an extension), the advisor stops auto-resuming it. An interrupting `concern`/`blocker` raised while the run is stopped is recorded as a visible advisor card instead of restarting the turn, and a concern already in flight when you interrupt is preserved the same way rather than driving a surprise resume. The advice re-enters context the next time you resume — a new message, the `.`/`c` continue shortcut, or a steer/follow-up.

A normal yield the agent drove itself is treated differently from a deliberate interrupt, but it is not a blanket "always steers and resumes". The loop state and completed turn first determine the normal delivery path:

- **While the loop is still streaming** (the raise arrived before the yield, or during a resume you already drove), the note normally steers into the live turn.
- **Once the loop has yielded and gone idle**, delivery keys on how the turn ended:
  - If the primary's tail is a **terminal text answer with no queued work**, a late `concern` is preserved as a visible card rather than waking the agent to restate a completed turn (#4840) — it re-enters context on the next resume (a new message, `.`/`c`, or a steer/follow-up), exactly like the interrupt case. A `blocker` is the exception: it normally steers a triggered turn, because it means the agent handed off broken or unexercised work that must be acknowledged before the turn is considered done (#5628).
  - Otherwise (the agent yielded mid-work, no terminal answer), an idle `concern`/`blocker` normally triggers a fresh turn so the advice is acted on immediately.

Two session/client constraints can still preserve a note whose normal delivery path is steering:

- **Plan mode:** every would-be advisor steer is preserved as a visible card, even while the primary loop is streaming, because only user-driven turns converge on ask/resolve.
- **ACP with deferred agent-initiated turns:** when `deferAgentInitiatedTurns` is enabled and the bridge has not allowed agent-initiated turns, an idle would-be steer is preserved because the client cannot represent the triggered turn as busy. Advice raised while the primary loop is already streaming can still steer into that live turn.

So the advisor can steer and resume a run the agent ended on its own **while it is running or yielded mid-work and the current mode/client permits steering**. When steering is blocked instead, the note is either preserved as a card (the terminal-answer, plan-mode, and deferred-ACP cases above) or downgraded to a non-interrupting aside (the `advisor.immuneTurns` cooldown below); either way it waits for the next step boundary or resume rather than waking the agent.

`advisor.immuneTurns` limits interruption frequency. After the advisor successfully delivers a `concern` or `blocker` through the steering channel, later concerns/blockers are routed as non-interrupting asides until the configured number of primary turns has completed. The default is `3`. `nit` notes are unchanged, and advice raised while user-interrupt auto-resume suppression is active is still preserved instead of restarting a stopped run.

### Emission guard

`AdvisorEmissionGuard` (in `src/advisor/emission-guard.ts`) sits on the `enqueueAdvice` boundary in `AgentSession` and enforces — in code — the advisor system prompt's "at most one `advise` per update" and "NEVER send the same advice twice" rules. Each call to the advisor's `advise` tool runs through the guard before it routes to the YieldQueue / steer channel:

1. **Normalization.** Lowercase, NFKC, collapse every run of non-alphanumeric characters to a single space, trim. `"Stop."`, `"*Stop*"`, and `"  stop  "` all key to `stop`.
2. **Content-free phrase filter.** A small allowlist of normalized phrases the advisor occasionally emits but that carry no concrete reason — `stop`, `done`, `complete`, `no issue continue`, `lgtm`, `nothing to add`, `no further input`, and similar — is suppressed silently. Silence is the correct expression of "no concerns".
3. **Exact-text dedupe.** Any normalized note already accepted in this session is dropped. The dedupe history is bounded by a FIFO ring (default 4096 entries).
4. **Per-update rate limit.** At most one note per advisor model `prompt()` cycle is accepted; the runtime calls `host.beginAdvisorUpdate?.()` before each cycle to reset the gate. Suppressed calls never consume the budget — a noise call doesn't displace a real concern that follows in the same update.

Suppression is invisible to the advisor model: `AdviseTool` still returns `Recorded.` for a dropped call. Surfacing "suppressed" back into advisor context risks the model rephrasing the same useless note to bypass the dedupe.

The guard's full state — dedupe history and per-update gate — clears on every advisor reset (compaction, session switch, `/new`), so a re-primed reviewer can re-raise issues it already raised against the rewritten transcript.

## Bounded catch-up with `advisor.syncBacklog`

`advisor.syncBacklog` is not lockstep turn execution. It is a bounded catch-up delay for the primary agent when the advisor falls behind.

Allowed values:

- `off` — never wait for advisor catch-up
- `1`
- `3`
- `5`

On primary turn end:

1. the primary turn delta is queued for the advisor
2. the advisor drain loop starts or continues in the background
3. if `advisor.syncBacklog` is not `off`, the primary agent waits only while advisor backlog is at or above the configured threshold
4. the wait is capped at 30 seconds
5. if the advisor catches up below the threshold, the primary continues immediately
6. if the cap expires, the primary continues anyway

Practical interpretation:

- `off` favors maximum primary throughput.
- `1` is the closest mode to synchronous review: after each queued advisor delta, the primary waits up to 30 seconds for backlog to return to zero.
- `3` and `5` allow more advisor lag before the primary pauses.

Advisor failures do not permanently stall the primary. A failed advisor prompt is retried; after three consecutive advisor failures, the runtime logs a warning, drops the backlog, and lets the session continue.

## WATCHDOG.md

`WATCHDOG.md` is advisor-only guidance. It is appended to the advisor system prompt; it is not injected into the primary agent's normal context and does not behave like `AGENTS.md`, `RULES.md`, or other context files.

Use it for review priorities: risks the advisor should watch for, project-specific traps, dangerous APIs, architectural boundaries, and quality bars that are useful to a reviewer but too noisy for the main executor.

Example:

```markdown
# Watchdog notes

Especially watch for:

- Changes that bypass the durable queue in `src/jobs/`.
- UI renderer paths that display unsanitized tool output.
- New worker spawns that do not re-enter the CLI host.
```

### Discovery locations

`discoverWatchdogFiles(cwd, agentDir)` loads every readable candidate from these locations:

1. user level: `<active agent dir>/WATCHDOG.md` (`~/.omp/agent/WATCHDOG.md` by default; relocated by `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`)
2. project levels while walking from `cwd` upward to the git repository root, or to the home directory when no repo root is found:
   - `<dir>/WATCHDOG.md`
   - `<dir>/.omp/WATCHDOG.md`

Unlike native context files, watchdog discovery does not stop at the nearest project file. Multiple project watchdog files can load together.

Candidates in hidden owner directories are ignored unless the file is inside an `.omp` directory. This keeps unrelated dot-directory conventions from being picked up accidentally while still allowing `.omp/WATCHDOG.md`.

### `@` imports

`WATCHDOG.md` content is expanded with the same `@` import helper used by context files:

- relative imports resolve from the importing file's directory
- `~/` resolves from the user's home directory
- imports inside fenced code blocks and inline code spans stay literal
- cycles are skipped
- missing or unreadable imports leave the original `@path` text in place

### Prompt order

Loaded watchdog blocks are sorted as:

1. user-level `WATCHDOG.md`
2. project-level files from farther ancestors down toward `cwd`

Each file is appended to the advisor system prompt as:

```xml
Especially pay attention to:
<attention>
...expanded watchdog content...
</attention>
```

Later project files sit closer to the end of the advisor prompt, so narrower directory guidance is more prominent than broad ancestor guidance.

## WATCHDOG.yml

`WATCHDOG.yml` (or `WATCHDOG.yaml`) is the advisor roster. Where `WATCHDOG.md` supplies review priorities, `WATCHDOG.yml` declares the advisors themselves — one entry per name, each with its own model, tool grant, and specialization prompt. The `/advisor configure` overlay edits this file in place. Files that fail to parse or fail schema validation are logged and skipped so one bad project config cannot kill the session.

Example:

```yaml
instructions: |
  Everyone: prefer diffs that keep tests unified.

advisors:
  - name: Architecture
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:medium
    tools: [read, grep, glob]
    instructions: |
      Watch cross-module coupling and public-API growth.

  - name: Fixer
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:high
    tools: [read, grep, glob, edit, bash]
    instructions: |
      You may edit and run tests to prove a fix locally, then advise.
```

Fields:

- `instructions` (top level): shared prompt prepended to every advisor's system prompt alongside `WATCHDOG.md`. Concatenated across all discovered `WATCHDOG.yml` files.
- `advisors[].name`: human label; slugified for the session id and the `<session>/__advisor.jsonl` filename. Duplicate slugs across files are resolved by the same specificity rule as `WATCHDOG.md` discovery (project leaf > project ancestor > user).
- `advisors[].model`: optional model selector with optional `:level` thinking suffix (e.g. `x-ai/grok-code-fast:high`). Omitted → the advisor uses `modelRoles.advisor`.
- `advisors[].tools`: optional list of built-in tool names to grant. Omitted or empty → the default `read`/`grep`/`glob` subset. Any name in [`BUILTIN_TOOL_NAMES`](../packages/coding-agent/src/tools/builtin-names.ts) is accepted, including mutating tools (`edit`, `write`, `bash`, `eval`, `browser`, `debug`, `ast_edit`, `task`, `hub`, and the memory tools). Legacy aliases (`search`→`grep`, `find`→`glob`) are normalized. Unknown names are dropped with a warning. See [Tools and isolation](#tools-and-isolation) for the safety implications of granting mutating tools.
- `advisors[].instructions`: this advisor's specialization, appended after the shared baseline. Both instruction fields expand `@path` imports like `WATCHDOG.md`.

### Discovery locations

`WATCHDOG.yml`/`WATCHDOG.yaml` share the same user + project search path as `WATCHDOG.md`: the user-level `<active agent dir>/WATCHDOG.yml` plus every `WATCHDOG.yml`/`.omp/WATCHDOG.yml` encountered while walking from `cwd` up to the repository root (or the home directory when no repo root is found). All discovered files are loaded together; a more-specific file (project leaf > project ancestor > user) replaces an earlier entry with the same advisor slug.

## Subagents

`advisor.subagents` controls whether spawned task/eval subagents also get an advisor runtime.

- `false` (default): only the main session can run an advisor.
- `true`: eligible subagent sessions build their own advisor with the same settings/model-role resolution, then rerun `WATCHDOG.md` discovery for that subagent session's `cwd` and agent directory.

Subagent advisors remain isolated from the subagent's primary tool session in the same way the main advisor is isolated from the main agent.

## Cost and context behavior

Advisor usage is separate model usage. `/advisor status` reports advisor token counts and cost from the advisor agent's own transcript.

The advisor has its own append-only context. Before each advisor prompt, `AgentSession` estimates incoming tokens and may maintain advisor context:

1. try model-level context promotion when enabled and a larger compatible model is available
2. if promotion cannot fit enough context, compact the advisor's own message history
3. if compaction has no candidates or still cannot fit, re-prime from the current bounded primary transcript

The advisor's live context is in-memory and append-only; it is retained while the session runs so `/advisor dump` can inspect it, and is independently promoted/compacted/re-primed (above). It is not a replacement for the primary persisted transcript.

## Transcript persistence and observability

The advisor is a passive reviewer with its own model usage, so — like a task subagent — every finalized advisor turn is appended to a JSONL inside the owning session's artifacts dir:

- main session: `<session>/__advisor.jsonl`
- subagent advisor (`advisor.subagents: true`): `<session>/<SubId>/__advisor.jsonl`

The path is derived from the session file (not the artifacts dir, which subagents share with their parent), so each advisor writes a distinct file. The reserved `__advisor` stem cannot collide with a task subagent's `<id>.jsonl` (task id allocation reserves it).

Why a file:

- **Usage attribution.** `omp stats` scans each session folder recursively, so advisor assistant turns (with their usage/cost) are attributed to the same project/session like any other subagent. Advisor "session update" prompts are persisted as `synthetic`, agent-attributed user messages so they never inflate user-message metrics.
- **Observability.** The Agent Hub discovers `__advisor.jsonl` on open and shows it as a read-only `advisor`-kind transcript under its owning session.

The file follows session switches: on `/new`, resume/switch, and branch the recorder reopens at the new session's path on the next advisor turn; before a `/drop` deletes the old artifacts dir the recorder feed is detached and drained so a queued write cannot recreate the deleted file. The on-disk log is append-only and independent of the in-memory context — re-primes and compaction never truncate it.

The advisor is never a peer. The `advisor`-kind registry ref is excluded from every agent-facing surface — the `hub` peer roster and broadcast targets, the subagent peer prompt, and the `history://` index/lookup/completions — and cannot be messaged (`hub` send and collab chat refuse it) or revived/killed from the Agent Hub or collab. It is not addressable as a peer, regardless of what tools it has been granted.
