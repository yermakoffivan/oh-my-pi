/**
 * Regression test: MCP tool ownership must be tracked via `mcpServerName`,
 * not a `mcp__${serverName}_` tool-name prefix.
 *
 * Tool names are sanitized (server "atlassian:atlassian" mints
 * `mcp__atlassian_atlassian_*`), which breaks prefix matching two ways:
 *
 * 1. Collision: server "atlassian"'s prefix `mcp__atlassian_` also matches
 *    every `mcp__atlassian_atlassian_*` tool, so each reconnect/refresh of
 *    "atlassian" evicted the sibling server's tools and fired
 *    `onToolsChanged` with them missing — the session then steered paired
 *    unmount/mount notices into the conversation on every transport flap.
 * 2. Never-match: the raw prefix `mcp__atlassian:atlassian_` matches no
 *    sanitized tool name, so disconnecting "atlassian:atlassian" left its
 *    tools registered (and callable through a dead connection) and never
 *    notified consumers.
 *
 * Both server names here serve the identical fixture toolset, mirroring the
 * real-world duplicate-config shape (`<name>` plus imported `<source>:<name>`).
