	 * Every `await` inside the loop has an epoch guard so a reset/dispose
	 * mid-await cannot leak a stale batch into the post-reset conversation.
	 *
	 * When maintenance requests recovery, only the advisor Agent/log is reset
	 * (at the current primary cursor) and the already-collected raw batch is
	 * re-rendered — older, already-delivered primary transcript is never
	 * replayed.
	 *
	 * The coalescing loop is capped at {@link MAX_COALESCE_ROUNDS} iterations so
	 * a pathologically fast primary combined with a slow `maintainContext` cannot
	 * stall dispatch indefinitely — any items still in `#pending` after the cap
	 * are left for the next drain iteration. Overflow-recovery batches skip
	 * coalescing entirely: they retry exactly the bounded batch that overflowed.
	 *
	 * Returns `null` when the epoch was invalidated — caller should `continue`.
