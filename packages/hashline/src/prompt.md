Your patch language names lines to replace, delete, or insert at, then lists the new content. Rule of thumb: a header ending in `:` is followed by `+` body rows; `DEL` has no body.

<critical>
- Input is ONE patch string. NEVER pass an array.
- Ranges use `N.=M` exactly. NEVER commas or `:=:`.
</critical>

<headers>
Every file section starts with `[PATH#TAG]`. `TAG` = 4-hex snapshot tag from your latest `read`/`search`, REQUIRED on every section — no hashless form. Create new files with `write`; hashline only edits existing files.
</headers>

<ops>
`SWAP N.=M:` — replace original lines N.=M with the body rows below. INCLUSIVE — line M is consumed too.
`SWAP.BLK N:` — replace the whole syntactic block that BEGINS on line N; tree-sitter resolves the closing line. Body rows below.
`DEL N.=M` — delete original lines N.=M. No body.
`DEL.BLK N` — delete the whole syntactic block that BEGINS on line N.
`INS.PRE N:` — insert the body rows immediately before line N.
`INS.POST N:` — insert the body rows immediately after line N.
`INS.BLK.POST N:` — insert the body rows after the END of the block that BEGINS on line N — outside it, at sibling depth. To append inside a block, use `INS.POST`.
`INS.HEAD:` / `INS.TAIL:` — insert the body rows at the very start / end of the file.
`REM` — delete the whole file named by the section header. No body, no line ops.
`MV DEST` — move/rename the section file to `DEST` (a path, quoted when it contains spaces). Line edits above `MV` land on the source first, then the final content is written at `DEST`.
Single line: `SWAP N.=N:` / `DEL N`. The range is the ORIGINAL lines you touch; body length is irrelevant (replacing 1 line with 10 is still `SWAP N.=N:`).
</ops>

<body-rows>
Body rows appear only under a `:` header. Every body row is `+TEXT` — add a literal line `TEXT`, verbatim (leading whitespace kept); `+` alone adds a blank line. No other row kind. NEVER write `-old` or a bare/context line. To keep a line, leave it out of every range. Literal lines starting with `-`/`+` still need the body prefix: Markdown `- item` → `+- item`, `+ item` → `++ item`.
</body-rows>

<rules>
- Line numbers + `[PATH#TAG]` header come from your latest `read`/`search` (`LINE:TEXT` rows).
- Numbers refer to the ORIGINAL file; never shift as hunks apply.
- They die with the call: every applied edit mints a fresh `#TAG` and renumbers — anchor the next edit on the edit response or a fresh `read`.
- Touch only lines your latest `read`/`search` literally displayed as `LINE:TEXT`; the tag certifies the snapshot, not your memory. A hunk anchored on a line you never displayed is REJECTED — re-`read` first. Seeing a line ≠ it holds the code you mean; confirm numbers map to the construct you intend, especially far from your read window.
- Elided regions are UNSEEN: `…`/`..` markers and a collapsed `N-M:` summary row (only boundary lines N and M shown) hide their interior. NEVER place or span a hunk inside one — `read` the range first.
- Never start or end a range mid-expression or mid-block.
- Indent body rows exactly for the depth they should live at.
- On a stale-tag rejection or any surprising result: STOP and re-`read` before further edits.
- One hunk per range; body = final content, never an old/new pair.
- Ranges cover ONLY lines whose content changes. Never widen over unchanged lines — a stale wide range shreds everything it spans.
- Whole construct → `SWAP.BLK N` (tree-sitter resolves the end); lines inside it → `SWAP N.=M`.
- `SWAP.BLK N` resolves EXACTLY the node at N. Leading decorators/attributes/doc-comments are separate nodes: point N at the FIRST decorator to sweep both; standalone line-comments are never swept — use `SWAP N.=M`.
- Block ops (`SWAP.BLK`/`DEL.BLK`/`INS.BLK.POST`) anchor the OPENING line of a MULTI-LINE construct — never its closer, last line, or a bare inner statement. Anchoring one statement resolves to ONE line and is REJECTED: use the plain op (`SWAP N.=N` / `DEL N` / `INS.POST N`), or point N at the real opener. Saw the closer? Use plain `INS.POST M:`.
- Markdown: a heading line IS a block opener — `SWAP.BLK`/`DEL.BLK`/`INS.BLK.POST` on a `##`/`###` heading resolves its WHOLE section (heading through every nested deeper heading, up to the next same-or-higher heading). So `DEL.BLK` drops the section, `SWAP.BLK` rewrites it, `INS.BLK.POST` lands after it (end the inserted body with a blank line to keep the next heading separated).
- Non-adjacent changes = separate hunks; untouched lines stay out of every range.
- Pure additions use `INS.PRE` / `INS.POST` / `INS.HEAD` / `INS.TAIL`, never a widened `SWAP` — retyped keepers are exactly what gets dropped. (A multi-line `SWAP` whose body restates the line just past the range is auto-dropped as an off-by-one keeper with a warning — issue the payload for the range only; never lean on the repair.)
- NEVER format/restyle code with this tool; run the project formatter instead.

<example>
Original (the exact shape `read` returns):
```
[greet.py#A1B2]
1:def greet(name):
2:    msg = "Hello, " + name
3:    print(msg)
4:greet("world")
```

Insert a guard after line 1:
```
[greet.py#A1B2]
INS.POST 1:
+    if not name: name = "stranger"
```

Replace line 2 with two lines:
```
[greet.py#A1B2]
SWAP 2.=2:
+    greeting = "Hi"
+    msg = f"{greeting}, {name}"
```

Delete line 3:
```
[greet.py#A1B2]
DEL 3
```

Delete the whole file:
```
[greet.py#A1B2]
REM
```

Rename or move the file:
```
[greet.py#A1B2]
MV greet_v2.py
```

Move after editing:
```
[greet.py#A1B2]
SWAP 1.=3:
+def greet(name):
+    print(f"Hi, {name}")
MV lib/greet.py
```

Add a header and trailer:
```
[greet.py#A1B2]
INS.HEAD:
+# generated header
INS.TAIL:
+greet("everyone")
```

Insert Markdown bullets — the leading `+` is the body-row marker; the file receives `- task`:
```
[PLAN.md#A1B2]
INS.POST 2:
+- task
+  - nested task
```

Replace the whole `greet` function block — `SWAP.BLK 1:` resolves lines 1–3 (the `def` header through `print(msg)`); line 4 is a separate statement and stays:
```
[greet.py#A1B2]
SWAP.BLK 1:
+def greet(name):
+    print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

A decorator/doc-comment is a SEPARATE block — `SWAP.BLK` on the `def`/`fn` line keeps it. Point N at the decorator to take both; here line 1 is `@cache`, so anchoring on the `def` (line 2) would orphan `@cache`:
```
[svc.py#C3D4]
SWAP.BLK 1:
+@cache
+def load(key):
+    return store[key]
```
</example>

</anti-patterns>

<critical>
If you remember nothing else:
1. INPUT IS ONE STRING. NEVER pass patch lines as an array.
2. RE-GROUND AFTER EVERY EDIT. Every apply mints a fresh `#TAG` and renumbers — take the next edit's numbers from the edit response or a fresh `read`. Stale tag or surprise? STOP, re-`read`.
3. RANGES ARE EXACT. Use `N.=M`; NEVER commas or `:=:`.
4. RANGES ARE TIGHT. Cover only lines that change; a stale wide range shreds everything it spans. Whole construct → `SWAP.BLK N`.
5. THE BODY IS THE FINAL CONTENT. Every body row starts with `+`; Markdown bullets use `+- item`, not `- item`.
