/**
 * High-level patch orchestrator. Reads each section's target file via the
 * configured {@link Filesystem}, strips BOM and normalizes line endings,
 * validates the section snapshot tag (with {@link Recovery}), applies the
 * result back through the same {@link Filesystem}.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *
 * - {@link Patcher.apply} — high-level, all-or-nothing. Preflights every
 *   section in memory before any write hits disk, then commits in order.
 * - {@link Patcher.prepare} / {@link Patcher.commit} — granular primitives
 *   for callers that need per-section control (e.g. batched LSP flush,
 *   custom interleaving). `prepare` performs all the read-side work,
 *   validates the section snapshot tag (with recovery), and applies the
 *   edits in memory. `commit` writes the prepared result and records a
 *   fresh snapshot.
 *
 * Because `prepare` already runs the full apply, a multi-section batch is
 * naturally all-or-nothing: by the time any `commit` runs, every section
 * has been validated.
 *
 * The patcher itself is stateless across calls; reuse one instance per
 * filesystem configuration.
