# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [14.9.5] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Added an `isError?: boolean` field on `AgentToolResult` so tools can flag a non-throwing failure (e.g. an aggregator that catches per-entry errors). `coerceToolResult` preserves the flag and the agent loop surfaces it as a tool error on the wire.

## [14.9.3] - 2026-05-10
### Added

- Added `onHarmonyLeak` option on `Agent`/loop config to receive GPT-5 Harmony leak audit callbacks
- Added harmony-leak detection and audit exports to the package index for programmatic leak detection and recovery hooks

### Changed

- Changed OpenAI Codex model runs to detect GPT-5 Harmony protocol leakage during streaming and automatically retry or recover tool calls instead of sending contaminated arguments downstream

### Security

- Hardened tool-call handling against leaked `to=functions.*` protocol tails by truncating or retrying before execution
- Hardened failure handling so repeated GPT-5 Harmony leak mitigation is retried only up to two times before escalating to an explicit error

## [14.9.0] - 2026-05-10
### Added

- Added `Agent#metadata` field forwarded to every API request; callers can set arbitrary provider metadata (e.g. `metadata.user_id`) once and have it applied to all subsequent stream calls without modifying per-call options
- Added `Agent#setMetadataResolver(fn)` for installing a function that resolves request metadata at call time. The `metadata` getter dispatches through the resolver on every read (including the snapshot taken per `prompt()`), so callers reflect mutable external state (e.g. live OAuth account UUID after a token refresh) without manual re-syncs. Plain `agent.metadata = …` continues to set a static value and clears any installed resolver.

### Added

- Added an `onSseEvent` agent option and loop config forwarding path for raw provider SSE diagnostics.

## [14.7.6] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added `hideThinkingSummary` option/getter/setter on `Agent` and `AgentLoopConfig`. Forwarded to the underlying stream call so providers can omit reasoning/thinking summaries on demand.
## [14.7.2] - 2026-05-06
### Added

- Added `loadMode` option to `AgentTool` to mark built-in tools as `essential` for initial loading or `discoverable` for search activation
- Added optional `summary` field to `AgentTool` definitions for one-line text used in tool discovery indexes

## [14.7.0] - 2026-05-04
### Breaking Changes

- Changed `Agent` API types so `systemPrompt` is now a list of prompt strings, requiring callers to pass and update system prompts via string arrays

### Changed

- Removed automatic project-context injection into each model call from loop logic

### Removed

- Removed the `projectPrompt` field from agent state/context and the `setProjectPrompt` mutator

## [14.6.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- Fixed unhandled promise rejection when `getApiKey` or any other async error occurs during `streamAssistantResponse`: agent loop IIFEs now catch and route errors through `EventStream.fail()`, which terminates the `for await` loop and lets `Agent#runLoop`'s catch block create a proper error assistant message instead of crashing

## [14.6.0] - 2026-05-02
### Fixed

- Fixed request cancellation before provider events by emitting an aborted assistant message and ending the stream with `stopReason: "aborted"`

## [14.5.10] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added an `onResponse` stream option for observing provider response metadata after response headers arrive.

## [14.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- Changed tool dispatch to match model-returned tool calls by either internal tool name or custom wire name, enabling custom OpenAI tool names such as `apply_patch`.

## [14.0.1] - 2026-04-08
### Added

- Added `onAssistantMessageEvent` callback option to inspect assistant streaming events before they are emitted, enabling abort decisions before buffered events continue flowing
- Added `setAssistantMessageEventInterceptor()` method to dynamically set or update the assistant message event interceptor

## [13.13.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Added `startup.checkUpdate` setting, set to `true` by default, can be disabled to skip the update check on agent initialization

## [13.12.7] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Added overload for `prompt()` method accepting a string input with optional options parameter

### Fixed

- Fixed stale forced toolChoice being passed to provider after tools are refreshed mid-turn

## [13.9.16] - 2026-03-10
### Added

- Added `onPayload` option to `AgentOptions` to inspect or replace provider payloads before they are sent

## [13.9.3] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Exported `ThinkingLevel` selector constants and types for configuring agent reasoning behavior
- Added `inherit` thinking level option to defer reasoning configuration to higher-level selectors
- Added `serviceTier` option to configure service tier for agent requests

### Changed

- Changed `thinkingLevel` from required string to optional `Effort` type, allowing undefined state

### Fixed

- Fixed synthetic tool result text formatting so aborted/error tool results no longer emit `Tool execution was aborted.: Request was aborted` style punctuation.
## [13.3.7] - 2026-02-27
### Added

- Added `lenientArgValidation` option to tools to allow graceful handling of argument validation errors by passing raw arguments to execute() instead of returning an error to the LLM

## [13.3.1] - 2026-02-26
### Added

- Added `topP`, `topK`, `minP`, `presencePenalty`, and `repetitionPenalty` options to `AgentOptions` for fine-grained sampling control
- Added getter and setter properties for sampling parameters on the `Agent` class to allow runtime configuration

## [13.1.0] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

- Removed per-tool `agent__intent` field description from injected schema to reduce token usage; intent format is now documented once in the system prompt instead of repeated in every tool definition
## [12.19.0] - 2026-02-22
### Changed

- Updated tool result messages to include error details when tool execution fails

## [12.14.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added `intentTracing` option to enable intent goal extraction from tool calls, allowing models to specify high-level goals via a required `_intent` field that is automatically injected into tool schemas and stripped from arguments before execution

## [12.11.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Exported `AgentBusyError` exception class for handling concurrent agent operations

### Changed

- Agent now throws `AgentBusyError` instead of generic `Error` when attempting concurrent operations

## [12.8.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- Added `transformToolCallArguments` option to `AgentOptions` and `AgentLoopConfig` for transforming tool call arguments before execution (e.g. secret deobfuscation)

## [11.3.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- Agent loop callbacks now use `getSteeringMessages` and `getFollowUpMessages` instead of `getQueuedMessages`

## [1.337.1] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

- Forked to @oh-my-pi scope with unified versioning across all packages

## [1.337.0] - 2026-01-02

Initial release under @oh-my-pi scope. See previous releases at [badlogic/pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Transport abstraction removed**: `ProviderTransport`, `AppTransport`, and `AgentTransport` interface have been removed. Use the `streamFn` option directly for custom streaming implementations.

- **Agent options renamed**:
  - `transport` → removed (use `streamFn` instead)
  - `messageTransformer` → `convertToLlm`
  - `preprocessor` → `transformContext`

- **`AppMessage` renamed to `AgentMessage`**: All references to `AppMessage` have been renamed to `AgentMessage` for consistency.

- **`CustomMessages` renamed to `CustomAgentMessages`**: The declaration merging interface has been renamed.

- **`UserMessageWithAttachments` and `Attachment` types removed**: Attachment handling is now the responsibility of the `convertToLlm` function.

- **Agent loop moved from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`**: The `agentLoop`, `agentLoopContinue`, and related types have moved to this package. Import from `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent` instead.

### Added

- `streamFn` option on `Agent` for custom stream implementations. Default uses `streamSimple` from pi-ai.

- `streamProxy()` utility function for browser apps that need to proxy LLM calls through a backend server. Replaces the removed `AppTransport`.

- `getApiKey` option for dynamic API key resolution (useful for expiring OAuth tokens like GitHub Copilot).

- `agentLoop()` and `agentLoopContinue()` low-level functions for running the agent loop without the `Agent` class wrapper.

- New exported types: `AgentLoopConfig`, `AgentContext`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolResult`, `AgentToolUpdateCallback`, `StreamFn`.

### Changed

- `Agent` constructor now has all options optional (empty options use defaults).

- `queueMessage()` is now synchronous (no longer returns a Promise).
